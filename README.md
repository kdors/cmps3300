This is a personnel manager for ROTC cadets. It is a way to track cadets' attendance and workout schedules, as well as post all notifications and messages so that information is in an easy to access place for every member. This application is designed to make it easy for cadet managers to track each cadet and maintain order within an organization where it was once hard to do so. Also, events and notices can change. While before it was hard to make sure all cadets were always up-to-date with what was going on, with this app, posting messages and sending reminders is easy, so now everyone will always stay in the loop.
